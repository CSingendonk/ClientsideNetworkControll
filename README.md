# ClientsideNetworkControll

   A single file containing a JavaScript IIFE that returns and initiates a completely client-side,
   vanilla in-page UI. This tool logs and, if desired, blocks network traffic before it completes—acting
   as a border guard of sorts. With extensive options, you can control what, how, where, when, and even
   if logging occurs. Manage DOM events and mutations, performance metrics, console output, and more—all
   dynamically within your active browser tab.

   -- This is an obsolete draft copy of the complete code from a previous point in time and state.
   -- It does work when ran in the document browser scope.. however you get it there ;)
   Please contact for collaboration.

   ## COPYRIGHT & RESTRICTIONS

   Copyright (c) 2024-2026 Chris Singendonk. All Rights Reserved.  

   This work is **NOT LICENSED** for public or private use, modification, distribution, reproduction,
   or the creation of derivative works **without explicit written approval from the author**.  
   The default copyright laws apply, meaning **you may not use, modify, or distribute any part of this work
   in any form** unless you have received direct permission from the copyright holder.  

   Unauthorized usage, reproduction, modification, or distribution of this work, in whole or in part,
   is a violation of copyright law.  

   ===========================================================
   Think of it this way:  
   You’ve poured countless hours into designing a gravity-defying, tune-playing flying car.
   You share your creation selectively, knowing that collaboration is the key to progress.
   Others recognize its potential, but instead of working with you, they take the blueprint and run with it,
   making improvements behind closed doors while you remain unaware.  

   They release their own version, solve problems you never encountered, and refine the design—but you,  
   the original creator, are left out of the loop, unable to learn from or contribute to what has become  
   of your own work. Your progress is artificially limited, while others reap the rewards of your effort.  

   This is why permission and attribution matter:  
   Innovation isn’t just about the end product—it’s about **inclusion, shared learning, and the mutual respect**
   that comes from working together. Acknowledgment ensures that those who plant the seeds of progress  
   are not cast aside while others harvest the results.  

   ===========================================================
   ## CONTACT FOR APPROVAL

   If you are interested in using, modifying, or building upon this work,  
   **you must first obtain explicit written permission from the author.**  
   I welcome collaboration, but only when mutual understanding and respect are upheld.
