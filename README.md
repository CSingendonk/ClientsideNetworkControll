# (w.i.p) ClientsideNetworkControll
  A single file containing a JavaScript iife that returns and initiates a completely client-side vanilla in-page ui where you can log and additionally block network traffic before it completes (basically a border guard per se) and prompts you to disintegrate or allow each request using thread blocking logic.

 # Think of it this way: 
 You’ve spent countless hours designing a gravity-defying, tune-playing flying car.  
 You share your work freely, knowing that collaboration is the key to progress. Others join in, improving the design, pushing it further than you ever could alone.  
 But somewhere along the way, the updates stop reaching you. Your team moves forward, building on what you started, but without your knowledge.  
 They launch new models, refine the technology, solve problems you never even knew existed—while you, the original creator, are left staring at your old blueprints,  
 unable to grow, to learn, or to contribute to what has become of your own work.  

 ### This is why attribution matters. 
 Not just as a form of respect, but as a means of keeping creators connected to their creations.  
 Innovation isn’t just about the product—it’s about the people behind it, learning, improving, and evolving together.  
 Acknowledgment ensures that those who plant the seeds of progress aren’t left in the dark while others harvest the rewards.
