# ClientsideNetworkControll
A single file containing a JavaScript iife that returns and initiates a completely client-side vanilla in-page ui where you can log and additionally block network traffic before it completes (basically a border guard per se) and prompts you to disintegrate or allow each request using thread blocking logic.
